- 👋 Hi, I’m @Allys74, easy going but unstoppable
- 👀 I’m interested in learn everything to become a Data Analyst
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Git, I'm a beginner but I practice a lot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with everyone, I´m here for the experience of learning!
- 📫 How to reach me: I may need discord for this, let's try "Gum74"
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her but my dyslexic still say 'his' even if I'm hers ;3
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be vegan cuz my ex-gf was, but we broke up and I started to work on a butchery, not so proud of it but this side its delicious
